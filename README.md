# ErgoB

A brawlhalla macro, designed for easy short combo to hard short combo. This project took several months to finish, because my IRL problem. The result of this project pretty satisfying for me :D because I like the GUI. This project is written in Python. Because, Python really easy to learn. I have so much idea for GUI improvement for this project. Then the hard parts are making the combo. I have to switch from project to game, over and over again until I made a perfect combo.

Well, that's that. I don't have much words to say here. You can explore my python codes.

Happy Coding :)
